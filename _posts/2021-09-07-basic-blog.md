# how to make the most basic blog

i want you to write! i want to read what you write! you may ask "what if no one sees?" and to that i respond "your job is to write!".

it is easy to make excuses not to write. one easy excuse is a lack of a system for displaying our work like trophies. the reality is that your blog is useless without having written. i encourage you to write, to find your voice, and to display the work later as a collection.

in this work we will talk about a few low-code ways to begin sharing your voice.

## the design constraints

if you desire to have a blog, you should consider what writing tools work best for you. the decor of your blog is secondary to the value of your position in the things you write.

### gist

### hackmd

### dev.to

### github pages

## conclusion

just write! it can be scary to write, right? stop making excuses and find your voice.
